Brief discussion of my approach:
I made a function named returncontext.  I set the uc_link field to the context which contained the returncontext function for fuctions fun1,fun2,fun3.  When they returned, returncontext was called, which triggered a timer interrupt.

Detailed description of any problems I was not able to solve:
