		PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

this directory contains the sources from the text book
with minor modifications to support compilation on
a LINUX type system ... much of the source treats
pointers as 16 bit objects as they are in the PDP-11
... while an int on the PDP-11 is the same size as a
short which is the same size as an address, this is
not the case on most modern machines ... I have edited
the code to at least compile on 32 bit machines where
an int is the same size as an address, but if you use
the CS Dept. 64 bit Linux systems where an int is 32 bits
but an address is 64 bits you will have many compile
problems that you'll have to fix based on size 
incompatabilities ... these sources will compile successfully,
but there is no Makefile here, since these sources will
have to be modified and supplemented by you to get a
working version for assignments 2 and 3 ... you should 
construct your own Makefile when you have completed the
modifications and additions/deletions you need to build
a version of the system.
